# README

Simple app developed for demonstration purpose.
This app:

1. gets a JSON from the development machine.
2. Displays a list of events
3. When tapping a particular event, it show event details.


# Danger

Beware that this implementation is very fragile and do not always reflect Android Best Practices (e.g., no handling of network error, no `ViewHolder` pattern for Adapter).


# TODO

* Replace ActionBar with Toolbar
* Make it translucent
* Use AppCompat to get most of the Material Design to previous Android version
* Use shared element for transition animation between Activities
